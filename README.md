### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a computer science and engineering graduate. I've worked for many companies as an iOS Developer and UI/UX Designer and Graphic Designer.

I led the design team for a fitness company Gymble to help them design the UI/UX of the apps and website.
Then developed the complete iOS app for the company single-handedly and helped the company to launch the app in the app store.

Currently, I'm working as an iOS Developer for a company of 'IITians' and 'MITians'. It's a cognitive Development company. I launched their iOS app after building it from scratch. Also helped the company to set up the user flow of their apps in order to provide a swift UX.

Honoured with 'Product Owner Certificate' from the company for my valuable efforts in the company.

Right now I have two mainstream commercial apps live on the app store which is the backbone of the corresponding companies.
